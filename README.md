# Highlands-Revived
This is a 1.12.2 port of the Highlands mod, originally made by sdj64.

All textures have been grabbed from the original highlands repo [here](https://github.com/sdj64/Highlands/tree/master/src/main/resources/assets/highlands/textures/blocks) and [here](https://github.com/sdj64/Highlands/tree/26987bc4e69826b9b9ca68b0275bcc53b56decca/src/main/resources/assets/highlands/textures/blocks), some of which came from older commits.
